Hello, I'm **Zongnan Bao** (鲍宗南), I received my Master's degree in Computer Science at **UCLA** in 2023, and received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at **University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign** in 2021.

<!-- Aside from work & academics, I have a passion for photography and I enjoy sharing my photographs. I am proud to say that I am a top-1000 contributor on , as well as a Getty Images Contributor. All of my latest photographs are available for free download on Unsplash. Additionally, I have a love for music and started playing classical guitar, but have since transitioned to playing fingerstyle acoustic guitar.  -->
Outside of work and academics, I love photography and enjoy sharing my work -- I'm honored to be a top 1,000 contributor on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@nick19981122), gaining over 200M views and over 1M downloads. You can find my latest photos available for free on Unsplash. I also have a passion for music, started with classical guitar and later exploring fingerstyle.

### Experience

<img src="/images/misc/apple.png" alt="apple-logo" width="50" align="right"/>

###### [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)
<small>**Hardware and Software Modeling Engineer** - Present</small>

Working on performance modeling and analysis for Apple Silicons.

###### [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/home)
<small>**Camera System Architect** - 2 years & 2 months</small>

I spent over two years at Qualcomm as a Camera System Architecture Engineer working on Qualcomm Spectra ISP, where I focused on modeling and analyzing next-generation imaging pipelines. By developing frameworks to simulate camera dataflows and evaluate new architectural ideas, I helped guide early design decisions that improved efficiency, performance, and overall user experience in future mobile imaging solutions.

###### [Dolby Laboratories](https://www.dolby.com/)
<small>**Image Engineering Intern** - 6 Months</small>

During my time at Dolby, I had the opportunity to work as an Image Engineering Intern. My main project was focused on restoring image metadata from HDR/SDR pairs using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for [Dolby Vision](https://www.dolby.com/technologies/dolby-vision/). Additionally, I conducted research and successfully implemented deep learning papers for enhancing HDR photos. The project was successfully converted to a Patent titled [Estimating Metadata for Images Having Absent Metadata or Unusable Form of Metadata](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2024107472).


<img src="/images/misc/yitu.png" alt="yitu-logo" width="200" align="right"/>

###### [YITU Technology 依图科技](https://www.yitutech.com/en) 
<small>**Computer Vision Research Intern** - 3 Months</small>

As a Computer Vision Research Intern at YITU Technology, I was part of a team focused on using computer vision to make cities more "intelligent." During my time there, I was primarily responsible for training, evaluating, and improving object detection algorithms such as the Single-shot Multibox Detector (SSD).
