My name is **Zongnan Bao**. I'm a master student at **UCLA** studying **Computer Science**. Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from **University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign** in 2021 as a **Computer Engineering** student. 

In my spare time, I love photography and like to share my works. Currently, I am a top-1000 contributer on the platform named [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@zbao98), also a Getty Images Contributor. All of my recent photos will be uploaded to Unsplash and are free to download. In addition, I love music and I started out playing classical guitar and now I transitioned to acoustic guitar especially fingerstyles.

ðŸ‘€ I am actively seeking for new grad **Software Engineer** roles in 2022/2023!

##### [Dolby Laboratories](https://www.dolby.com/) - Image Engineering Intern
I'm currently working at Dolby as an Image Engineering Intern. I'm working on Dolby Vision related project aiming to restore image metadata from HDR/SDR pairs using Particle Swarms Optimization (PSO). Besides that, I also researched and implemented deep learning papers related to HDR photo enhancement.
