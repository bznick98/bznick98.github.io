My name is **Zongnan Bao**. I'm a master student at **UCLA** studying **Computer Science**. Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2021 as a Computer Engineering student. 

In my spare time, I love photography and like to share my works. Currently, I am a top-1000 contributer on the platform named [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@nick19981122), also a Getty Images Contributor. All of my recent photos will be uploaded to Unsplash and are free to download.
