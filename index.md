#### Welcome, 
###### I'm currently a MS student in UCLA studying Computer Science, focused on AI and Computer Vision. Before that, I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign at 2021 as a Computer Engineering student. 
<!-- ###### I'm currently a senior studying Computer Engineering at [UIUC](https://ece.illinois.edu/), my interests are Autonomous Vehicles, Computer Vision and AI&ML techniques used on Image Processing. I was advised by a really nice Professor [Sayan Mitra](https://mitras.ece.illinois.edu/) and his group during 2020 Summer, researched on reachability analysis of hybrid system, especially on the software tool [C2E2](http://publish.illinois.edu/c2e2-tool/). -->

###### In my spare time, I like photography and like to share my works. Currently, I've got 90,000,000+ views on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@nick19981122), and became top-1000 contributer on the platform. All of my newest works will be uploaded to Unsplash and are free to download, you can also view some of them under [Gallery](../photo_work/index.html) on this site, though the site may not get updated as often as on Unsplash.

###### P.S. I'm open to internships and research lab oppportunities, feel free to reach me plz!
